    <h3>Vietnam</h3>
    <img src="../images/vietnam.jpeg" alt="Vietnam">
    <p>I went to Vietnam back in middle school with my family. It was a vacation for
        me and my sisters and for my parents, it was the first time they went back since
        migrating to the US. We stayed there for a whole month and I got to experience all sorts
        of Vietnamese culture and meet a lot of my extended family. It was a super fun experience
        and I got to eat lots of delicious food.

    <h3>Japan</h3>
    <img src="../images/japan.webp" alt="Japan">
    <p>One of the countries I want to visit the most is Japan. From what I've seen, the country
        looks beautiful and well organized. I want to experience things such as their convenience stores,
        public bath houses, and their food. I also really want to experience the cherry blossoms over there.
        I've seen images of them when they bloom and it's something I want to experience in person.
