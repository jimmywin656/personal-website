                Currently, Valorant is the game I play the most, but I have played many other games such as: 
                League of Legends, and CSGO. I mainly enjoy multiplayer games as I enjoy working with teammates to
                achieve a goal. My rank in Valorant is Immortal 1, so I'd say I'm pretty good at the game.

                I recently started going to the gym this year and it has been really fun. I started going

                    Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed playing basketball. Although I never played it
                    competitively, I still enjoy watching and playing for fun with my friends.

                    I started playing badminton in highschool for my highschool team because my older
                    sister was on the team. My first year on the team, we ended up winning League Champs and
                    ever since then I've been playing. When covid hit in my 3rd year of highschool, I couldn't
                    play for two years. Now, I just play for fun whenever I have free time with my friends.
