                    I have always been fascinated with computers. Growing up, we had a family computer 
                    where I first fell in love with video games. Because the computer was an old all-in-one, it
                    died after a couple of years leading to me building my own computer. Over the years, my interests
                    in computers grew and I decided to major in computer science to further my knowledge of computers.

                    I recently just got a job at a Japanese market called Tokyo Central, where I help stock shelves and prep food.
                    The job is pretty easy going and and I found out that there are other CPP computer science majors that work there
                    as well.

            I live in Baldwin Park. Baldwin Park is a relatively small city about 15 minutes away from Pomona
            with not much to talk about. The most notable thing about Baldwin Park is that this is where the very
            first In-N-Out opened up.

                <span><strong>Valorant</strong></span>
                <p>Currently, Valorant is the game I play the most, but I have played many other games such as: 
                    League of Legends, and CSGO. I mainly enjoy multiplayer games as I enjoy working with teammates to
                    achieve a goal. My rank in Valorant is Immortal 1, so I'd say I'm pretty good at the game.

                <p>I first learned to play Chess at around 7 years old from my cousin however, I haven't really played since.
                    Recently in the last 2 years, Chess kind of blew up internet/gaming culture and that got me back into the game.
                    I play a couple games a day and although I am not good, rating of 800, I do enjoy the aspect of trying to outsmart
                    your opponents. I mainly play chess online on the site

                            Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed playing basketball. Although I never played it
                        competitively, I still enjoy watching and playing for fun with my friends.

                            I started playing badminton in highschool for my highschool team because my older
                            sister was on the team. My first year on the team, we ended up winning League Champs and
                            ever since then I've been playing. When covid hit in my 3rd year of highschool, I couldn't
                            play for two years. Now, I just play for fun whenever I have free time with my friends.
